            <p>There comes a time
              When we heed a certain call
              When the world must come together as one
              There are people dying
              Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
              The greatest gift of all
              We can't go on
              Pretending day-by-day
              That someone, somewhere soon make a change
              We're all a part of God's great big family
              And the truth, you know, love is all we need
              We are the world
              We are the children
              We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving
              There's a choice we're making
              We're saving our own lives
              It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me
              Oh, send them your heart
              So they know that someone cares
              And their lives will be stronger and free
              As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
              And so we all must lend a helping hand
              We are the world
              We are…</p>

            <p>Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound
              That saved a wretch like me
              I once was lost, but now am found
              T'was blind but now I see
              T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
              And Grace, my fears relieved
              How precious did that grace appear
              The hour I first believed
              Through many dangers, toils and snares
              We have already come.
              T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
              And grace will lead us home,
              And…</p>

            <p>Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
              My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
              She need something to change, need to take off the edge
              So fuck it all tonight
              And don't tell me to shut up
              When you know you talk too much
              But you don't got shit to say
              I want you out of my head
              I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
              There's no way I can save you (save you)
              'Cause I need to be saved, too
              I'm no good at goodbyes
              We're both actin' insane but too stubborn to change
              Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
              And my fingertip stained, looking over the edge
              Don't fuck with me tonight
              Say you needed this heart and you got it (got it)
              Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (wanted)
              And we wouldn't let go and we lost it (lost it)
              Now I'm…</p>
